# CLONING WEBSITE AS AN EXHAUST (experimental)

This feature allow you to clone your website as an exhaust server. The goal is to have a fake facade of your website, so everything before logging in into the website. Because the exhaust is only meant to exhaust hackers you won't be able to login.

This is still an experimental feature and still not implemented in the project.
Since this is experimental, it may not clone the full website and miss some pages, images, etc..

You are welcome to contribute to this "website cloning" script via pull requests or issues.
