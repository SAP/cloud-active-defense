# About this project
Cloud active defense lets you deploy decoys right into your cloud applications, putting adversaries into a dilemma: to hack or not to hack?
  * If they interact with any of your decoys, they are instantly detected.
  * If they refrain, they reduce their ability to attack, making your applications safer.

You win in either case.

# Requirements

- [Docker üê≥](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (you can do without, but this will make your life easier)


## Optional requirements
If you want to rebuild the plugin, you'll need these:
- [Go 1.19+](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/)


# Quickstart

1. clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/SAP/cloud-active-defense.git`

2. start in demo mode

```
cd cloud-active-defense
docker-compose up --build
```

3. check that it works

Visit `http://localhost:8000` from a web browser. You should be granted by a 'welcome' page. Inpect the network traffic (In Firefox: `CTRL+SHIFT+I`, visit 'Network', then click on the / request), notice the presence of an HTTP Response Header saying `x-cloud-active-defense=ACTIVE`

![x-cloud-active-defense header](./assets/header.png)

## Add a decoy

Let's add a first simple decoy. It won't be very useful but it is easy to understand.

1. stop the demo (CTRL-C in the docker window)

2. open file `cloud-active-defense/configmanager/cad-default.json`

3. replace the content with the following:

```
{
  "filters": [
    {
      "decoy": {
        "key": "x-cloud-active-defense",
        "separator": "=",
        "value": "ACTIVE"
      },
      "inject": {
        "store": {
          "inResponse": ".*",
          "as": "header"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "decoy": {
        "key": "forbidden"
      },
      "detect": {
        "seek": {
          "inRequest": ".*",
          "withVerb": "GET",
          "in": "url"
        },
        "alert": {
          "severity": "LOW",
          "whenSeen": true
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

4. restart the demo

`docker-compose up --build`

5. visit `http://localhost:8000/forbidden`. This should give you an error message `Cannot GET /forbidden`. Check that an alert was sent to the console with LOW severity.

## Add a post-authentication decoy

The decoy we just added might trigger if your application is scanned by bots, but what's more interesting is to detect compromised user accounts. So let's create a decoy which will be visible only to authenticated users.

1. stop the demo (CTRL-C in the docker window)

2. open file `cloud-active-defense/configmanager/cad-default.json`

3. replace the content with the following:

```
{
  "filters": [
    {
      "decoy": {
        "key": "x-cloud-active-defense",
        "separator": "=",
        "value": "ACTIVE"
      },
      "inject": {
        "store": {
          "inResponse": ".*",
          "as": "header"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "decoy": {
        "key": "forbidden"
      },
      "detect": {
        "seek": {
          "inRequest": ".*",
          "withVerb": "GET",
          "in": "url"
        },
        "alert": {
          "severity": "LOW",
          "whenSeen": true
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "decoy": {
        "key": "role",
        "separator": "=",
        "value": "user"
      },
      "inject": {
        "store": {
          "inResponse": ".*",
          "as": "cookie",
          "whenTrue": [
            {
              "key": "SESSION",
              "value": ".*",
              "in": "cookie"
            }
          ],
          "whenFalse": [
            {
              "key": "role",
              "value": ".*",
              "in": "cookie"
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      "detect": {
        "seek": {
          "inRequest": ".*",
          "in": "cookie"
        },
        "alert": {
          "severity": "HIGH",
          "whenModified": true
        }
      }
    }     
  ]
}
```

4. restart the demo

`docker-compose up --build`

5. visit `http://localhost:8000/login`. Login as **bob/bob**. Press `CTRL-SHIFT-I` to open the developer tools and navigate to the 'storage' tab. Notice how, upon login, a 'role=user' cookie was injected into your cookie jar.

![injected role cookie](./assets/cookie.png)

Modify manually the value of the role cookie by double-clicking its value in the developer view. Set it to 'admin', then refresh the page. Notice that an alert was sent to the console with HIGH severity. Seems that Bob is a hacker or that someone who guessed his not-so-strong password is trying to escalate privileges!

(the alert shows twice as it is triggered once by the `GET /` request and once by the `GET /favicon.ico` request)

# Architecture and Philosophy

Cloud active defense is about making hacking *painful*. Today, attackers rely on the information provided by the application to successfully exploit it. This information is under our control - and there is no reason not to lie to attackers.
We're not the first one to think about deploying deceptive element into applications. The [OWASP AppSensor](https://owasp.org/www-project-appsensor/) project came there first. But adding deceptive traps is an effort that's best kept separate from your application code:

  * developers might not have the time or security skills for that
  * adding code always bears the risk to introduce new (security!) bugs

Our approach was thus to let applications be protected by introducing a reverse-proxy, reading instructions from a versatile configuration file. No risk to introduce bugs to the application, and easy maintenance.

For the reverse-proxy, we chose [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/). At its heart, cloud active defense is simply a plugin for Envoy. We chose Envoy because it's open source, fast, extensible, and because it's a popular choice as a Service Mesh solution. What this means is that cloud active defense can easily be deployed as a side-car if you use a kubernetes platform such as [SAP Kyma](https://kyma-project.io/). We are doing our best to provide a working solution, but consider testing it heavily before using it productively (and please report any issues you discover!)

Architecture-wise, cloud active defense is a WASM file deployed within Envoy in its own container. As WASM cannot read files from the filesystem, we instead expose the config file in its own **configmanager** service and retrieve it from Envoy via HTTP. The default config file is named **cad-default.json**, by default this is what Envoy will fetch. When deployed in Kubernetes, each service can have its own config file, this is described in its own section.

![Main architecture](./assets/arch.png)

Envoy receives a request from the **browser** and forwards it to the **application**. Upon receiving the response from the application, Envoy checks if there is something to inject and behaves accordingly. On a subsequent request, Envoy checks if injected elements were interacted with and alerts accordingly.

Cloud active defense complements existing solutions such as Intrusion Detection Systems and honeypot-based deception by instrumenting the target web application itself. By adding decoys based on the application's business logic, you can raise high value, true positive alerts that warn your SOC team in real time before any harm is done. If you deploy decoys visible only to authenticated users, you can further detect account impersonation. This approach makes our solution unique.

## Myapp
Myapp is a demo application which can be used to test how decoys work. It is a simplistic web application with the following features:
  * `GET /` : the front page, displays 'welcome' if you're not authenticated. Displays a static 'dashboard' page otherwise.
  * `GET /login` : a form displaying a login field, a password field, and a submit button.
  * `POST /login` : checks if username is 'bob' and password is 'bob'. It not, sends an error message. If yes, authenticates by setting a (hardcoded) 'SESSION' cookie

There is no logout mechanism. Delete the SESSION cookie to log out.

## Configmanager
A simple application which returns the decoy config upon query.
  * `GET /:namespace/:application` : searches on disk for a file named /data/cad-\${namespace}-${application}.json, and returns its content. If not found, returns the content of cad-default.json

Envoy will send a GET request to configmanager a few times per minute and update its config accordingly. If running on docker-compose, 'namespace' and 'application' will both be empty strings, thus Envoy will always fetch the content of cad-default.json. If running on kubernetes, 'namespace' and 'application' will be properly set, allowing you to define one configuration per application per namespace.

## Envoy
Envoy is an open-source reverse proxy. Upon start, it reads the envoy.yaml config file, which loads the cloud-active-defense.wasm plugin. This plugin reads the content of cad-default.json and applies it upon receiving HTTP requests from the browser and HTTP responses from myapp.

# On the TODO list
Features we plan to eventually release:
  * [DONE] adding a configuration specifying where to find information about the user's session. We want to use this to add session / logged in user information in the alert.
  * show how to ingest alerts into fluentd for further processing (currently alerts are simply shown on the console)
